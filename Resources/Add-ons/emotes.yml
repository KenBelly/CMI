## STOPPPPPPPP, no no no no .. Let me explain how to use this:
## /stop your Minecraft 1.19.x server with CMI 9.2.x.x installed on it.
## Open the .yml files in (Windows) Notepad++ or (macOS) Sublime Text 4
## They are: plugins/CMI/CustomAlias.yml and this 1MB-emotes.yml
## Ignore this comment part at the top and copy everything after it.
## So from the beginning of the line, including the two spaces 
## in front of angry, all the way until the end of the file.
## And paste it at the bottom of CustomAlias.yml from CMI. 
## Make sure it's matching the rest of the file, no empty lines, 
## or weird wrapping or other things that invalidate YAML files.
## Nowwww, you can start your mc server, and you're good to go.

## Version 0.0.4 - dev - Internal release made by mrfloris
## Test server: 1moreblock.com:255565 (1.19), type: /emotes
