# :star: 1MoreBlock.com CMI Add-on

## <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Ingame Documentation

This little add-on is to assist both server owner, their team, and players, to have an in-game visualization of the CMI placeholders. Grouped, and parsed where possible. In the future we will add further documentation for additional CMI features.

## <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Purpose

Improve quick access in a visual way of a big plugin that can help server owners and players see what something is. I use this myself all the time, and I thought it would be nice to share with the public.

## <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Prerequisites

Okay, **let's get started**. Thank you for being interested in this little add-on.

Make sure CMI and CMILib are on the latest versions - this is made with CMI 9.2.x and CMILib 1.2.x in mind, for Minecraft 1.19.x

## <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Download Instructions

- Get the [cmi_placeholders.txt](/Resources/Add-ons/ingame-docs/cmi_placeholders.txt) file and put it inside the `~/plugins/CMI/CustomText/` directory.

- Optionally, if you wish to use MvdW placeholders one as well, get the [cmi_mvdw.txt](/Resources/Add-ons/ingame-docs/cmi_mvdw.txt) file and put it inside the `~/plugins/CMI/CustomText/` directory.

- Another file that we've worked on is [cmi_specializedcommands.txt](/Resources/Add-ons/ingame-docs/cmi_specializedcmds.txt).

## <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Installation Instructions

- After download, reload CMI with `/cmi reload`
- You can now use `/cmi ctext placeholders` to see what this does. You can use dsign, customalias command, IC, or whatever to point to this command, and/or any section within it. (for page 5: cmi ctext placeholders 5)

And that's it. No server restart required. There are no permissions to set.
