# Custom 'default' list for worth.yml

This shouldn't be a copy paste to use, this is an example for you to reference.

Please clone and make a pull request if you notice any missing enchantments, grammar/spelling or other issues. 
We're looking to complete this list, sort it on importannce and help the community generate at least a list of "i think mending should sell for more than unbreaking 2". 
At this point I have no idea how to approach this, so my first version, first build, is just going to be a collection of the currently available 39 Minecraft enchantments for Java Edition.

## Setting worth value for enchantments in CMI

You can use the `/cmi setworth` in-game to set the worth of an enchantment with CMI.

## List of available enchantments

PLEASE NOTE: This list should be sorted on highest value / importance, so server owners can offer a balanced set of sell options for the enchantments.

PLEASE NOTE: I am very much so open to contributions. Please clone this page and make a pull request with your suggestions, however, do include why you make the suggestion. Just 'i think it is worth more' is not really helping.
