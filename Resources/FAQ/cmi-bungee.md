- Download and Install the CMI-Bungeecord jar on only your proxy server (<https://www.zrips.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CMIB1.0.0.4.jar>)
- Update CMI's `config.yml` (see below)
```yaml
# Enable CMI Bungee Support 
BungeeCord:
  # You can disable bungeecord support entirely if you are exrperiencing issues with it
  # When setting this to false some features like public messages over bungee cord, private messages over bungeecord, portals over bungecoord and other features will stop working
  # Keep in mind that regular behavior of those features will remain intacted
  Enabled: true

# CMI config.yml, enable CMI Chat and CMI Bungee Chat
Chat:
  # Will try to modify chat to display it in defined format
  ModifyChatFormat: true

# Also:

  # Do you want to enable private messaging over bungeecord
  BungeeMessages: true
  # Do you want to enable public messaging over bungeecord
  BungeePublicMessages: true
  # Do you want to enable staff messaging over bungeecord
  BungeeStaffMessages: true
```
Then walk through all the other options related to chat. 

Don't forget to set-up appropriate permissions, such as:
`cmi.bungee.publicmessages.[servername]`


- And finally; `/stop` the server, and start it up again to guarantee that everything's working properly. More information on <https://www.zrips.net/cmi/>

## <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Misc.

**Placeholders:**
```
%cmi_user_bungeeserver%
%cmi_bungee_total_spawn%

%cmi_bungee_motd_spawn%
%cmi_bungee_onlinestatus_spawn%
```

**Commands:**
```
cmi server [serverName] (playerName) (-f) (Connects [playerName] to bungeecord server)
cmi serverlist (Show server list)
cmi bbroadcast (!) [message] (-s:[serverName,serverName]) (Sends special message to all players on all servers)
cmi sendall [serverName] (Send all online players to target server)
(and through CMI chat: /msg, /r, /staffmsg, .. i assume?)
```

**Permissions:**
```
cmi.command.serverlist - Show server list
cmi.command.serverlist.others - Show server list
cmi.command.server.others - Connect to bungeecord server
cmi.command.bbroadcast - Sends special message to all players on all servers
cmi.bungee.publicmessages.spawn - Allows to send public messages to target server
cmi.command.sendall.bypass - Prevents player from being sent to target server
cmi.command.sendall - Send all online players to target server
cmi.command.server - Connect to bungeecord server
```

**config.yml:**
```yaml
  # Attention! This will require you to have CMI Bungee plugin which can be found at zrips.net
  # Or direct download https://www.zrips.net/cmi/
  # Do you want to enable private messaging over bungeecord
  BungeeMessages: false
  # Do you want to enable public messaging over bungeecord
  BungeePublicMessages: false
  # Do you want to enable staff messaging over bungeecord
  BungeeStaffMessages: false

BungeeCord:
  # You can disable bungeecord support entirely if you are exrperiencing issues with it
  # When setting this to false some features like public messages over bungee cord, private messages over bungeecord, portals over bungecoord and other features will stop working
  # Keep in mind that regular behavior of those features will remain intacted
  Enabled: false
  # When set to true player names from entire bungee network will be included into tab complete
  NamesInTabComplete: false
```

**Installation instructions:** (from what i gathered)
- Buy a CMI license to use on your network, if you don't already have one.
- Install CMI on each individual server, obviously not the proxy server.
- Get CMI Bungee jar and put it on only the proxy, obviously not the servers behind the proxy.
- Configure CMI properly, use CMI chat, and enable Bungee as per this article.

I do not believe there's any `modules.yml` things that need to get enabled.

**FAQ:**
```
- if i run 3 servers and they're all on the same network, do i need three licenses? no, from what i gather that license covers the network
- is chat global? yes
- can i sync up economy on all servers? no, probably not (mysql player-data bridge plugin supporst cmi though)
- can all the /warps be the same on all servers? no
- what about homes? no
- can i use portals to teleport ppl to another server on the network? yes
- can i use /server or /server the way i want? yes alias.yml (/cmi server) (there's also /cmi serverlist)
- if a command doesn't support running on another server, can i still send it? what? no, i dont think so
- if a command doesn't move a player to another server, can i still do it? no, but yes, with /cmi aliaseditor you can make your own command that uses /cmi server and/or placeholders.
- are my inventories shared between servers? i doubt it, you probably need a bungee-inventory plugin dedicated to this (mysql player-data bridge plugin supporst cmi though)
- can i use 1 database for all cmi instances? no, default is sqlite, use mysql, and make sure they all use a unique prefix. Using 1 user table for every server for example will very very very likely cause massive issues.
- i put CMIB jar on the proxy (bungeecord) but it did not make any files or folders? yes, i dont think it does. On your 'servers' on the network type: /cmi version, if bungee is hooked, it should show there. Again, cmi goes to the servers behind the proxy, cmib jar goes to the proxy server only.
```

MYSQL player data bridge (third party plugin i was talking about) <https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mysql-player-data-bridge.8117/>

## <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> LATEST
Per CMI 9.0.4.3 this was in the changelog:
```
- Added better support for bungeeservers in the sense that now we can show custom messages when player switch servers to and from it. This will only works after you update CMIB plugin and only applies when you have custom login/logout messages enabled. New locale lines got added to CMI locale file
- Updating CMIB plugin will properly take player out of afk mode if he uses bungee only commands which previously would have been ignored
```
